          Staying healthy is certainly the major component of a happy life. But
          it is certainly not the only one. Someone might be perfectly fit, yet
          may not be fine. We does not live by bread alone, and this is true for
          the basics of our existence. Once the primary needs of health and
          safety are met, there still remains the key component of staying well
          and living well – an aspect that is very often overlooked when it
          comes to our senior citizens. They have the time, but no one to spend
          it with; they have the means, but no motivation to utilize them fully.
          We can call this component the Joys of Life – the so called
          trivialities and intangibles that add up to constitute a rich and full
          life. What might these be !! Here at Emopract we plan to address this
          and create smiles all around for the elders -- " Joys of Living "
