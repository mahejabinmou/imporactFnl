          The pivot of our existence. It is the state of optimum health – both
          of body and mind – that is crucial for a person to live fully and
          freely. We all want perfect health, but an endless litany of ailments
          plagues us day-in and day-out. Maybe not warranting hospitalization,
          but fretting us enough to take away our comfort and peace of mind.
          With the advancing years, these complaints increase exponentially, and
          are often the primary reasons for the lack of happiness of our elders.
          The Wellness component of Emopract will engage with this aspect.
